-Given a  2D Array, (6x6):
-We define an hourglass in  to be a subset of values with indices falling in this pattern in 's graphical representation:
a b c
  d
e f g
There are  hourglasses in , and an hourglass sum is the sum of an hourglass' values. Calculate the hourglass sum for every hourglass in , then print the maximum hourglass sum.

For example, given the 2D array:

-9 -9 -9  1 1 1 
 0 -9  0  4 3 2
-9 -9 -9  1 2 3
 0  0  8  6 6 0
 0  0  0 -2 0 0
 0  0  1  2 4 0
We calculate the following  hourglass values:

-63, -34, -9, 12, 
-10, 0, 28, 23, 
-27, -11, -2, 10, 
9, 17, 25, 18
Our highest hourglass value is  from the hourglass:

0 4 3
  1
8 6 6
